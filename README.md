# Forger
A simple Java stand-alone designed to make your documents plagarism free.

## Run It!
What do you need to run this? Regardless of whether you're on Windows, Linux or Mac this utility just requires **Java** to be installed on your system or you're gonna be presented with a weird response. (duh!) Also, the supplied file must be only a **.txt**. Run the batch `forger.bat` supplying the path to your **.txt** file. Your command should then look something like,
```
forger.bat "C:\Users\theGeekyLad\Documents\foo.txt"
```
If you've got Java setup rightly on your machine, and if the supplied file is nothing but a .txt, you're gonna be presented with a gorgeous success message, bingo. In all other cases, prepare to get surprised with exceptions!
